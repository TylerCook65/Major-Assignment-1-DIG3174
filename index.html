                The culture and feelings surrounding AI-Generated art are very mixed in today's world.
                Many people feel like AI art discredits actual artists who paint by hand,
                since AI art uses algorithms and code to create virtual images in various styles.
                However, AI artists claim that using these algorithms is just as valid as creating a painting or image by hand.
                AI art and these controversies have become more prominent in recent times because of the rapid advancement and popularity of AI technologies.
                On this site I will talk about everything related to the history, rise, and culture of AI-Generated art.

                Some of the first instances of humans using artificial intelligence to create images can be
                traced back all the way to the early days of computer graphics. This would be during the 1950s
                and 1960s, and engineers as well as mathematicians used computers to create basic patterns that
                were rendered on a screen.

                        In 1967, a German scientist named Frieder Nake created this image using algorithms and matrices
                        filled with numbers, which were multiplied into itself and eventually translated into a picture.

                Years later, more complicated software was developed to allow digital designers to create and
                change shapes on a computer. One of the more well-known programs was called AARON, which was created
                by Harold Cohen in 1973. This allowed computers to draw similarly to how humans would freehand a painting
                and it also let the computer make certain decisions on its own.

                        This is an abstract portrait of a person that was created by AARON. In just a few years the advancement
                        of artificial intelligence has gone from simple patterns to whole coherent images.
