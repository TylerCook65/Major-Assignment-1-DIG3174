            The culture and feelings surrounding AI-Generated art are very mixed in today's world. 
            Many people feel like AI art discredits actual artists who paint by hand, 
            since AI art uses algorithms and code to create virtual images in various styles. 
            However, AI artists claim that using these algorithms is just as valid as creating a painting or image by hand.
            AI art and these controversies have become more prominent in recent times because of the rapid advancement and popularity of AI technologies.
            On this site I will talk about everything related to the history, rise, and culture of AI-Generated art.
